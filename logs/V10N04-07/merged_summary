Modelling the dynamic nature of vocabulary is important, not only theoretically but also practically. It is important theoretically because there has been little concrete work on the dynamics that underly the structure of vocabulary at an idiosynchronic slice of language although speculatively these dynamics are widely held to be important. It is important practically because it can give a basic perspective from which the problem of so-called ``lexical bottleneck" in many NLP-related applications can be diagnosed. This task is especially important to the study of technical terminologies, due to their rapid growth in many different domains. This, however, is an area of research that has thus far gone unexplored.
