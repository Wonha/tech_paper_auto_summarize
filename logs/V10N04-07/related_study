 As the basic data for the analysis, we use lists of term types, as opposed
 to term tokens in texts, and analyse the quantitative nature of constituent
 elements or morphemes within the list of term types. There are two
 reasons for this. Firstly, as terms are basically created by lexical
 formation, the quantitative nature of morphemes in terminology is
 independent of the token frequency of terms \cite{sager90,kage02}.
 Recent psycholinguistic studies also support this claim \cite{baayen97,schreuder97}.
 Secondly, as the majority of terms are complex \cite{nomura89} and
 new terms are constantly formed by compounding, the quantitative nature
 of morphemes in the construction of terminologies is a key element
 for the modelling of terminological structure.

 With the correspondences between text and terminology, sentences and
 terms, and words and morphemes, the present work can be regarded as
 parallel to the quantitative study of words in texts
 \cite{zipf35,yule44,mandelbrot53,simon55,carrol67,sichel75}.
 Terms in the field of quantitative linguistics, such as ``type", ``token",
 etc., shall be used in this context.

 Chose for the present study are the terminological data of the following six 
 different domains: agriculture (AGR) \cite{agrterm}, botany
 (BOT) \cite{botterm}, chemistry (CHM) \cite{chmterm}, computer science
 (COM) \cite{aiso}, physics (PHY) \cite{phyterm} and psychology (PSY)
 \cite{psyterm}. They were chosen, within the limited availability
 of terminological data from roughly the same period, to cover both
 ``harder" and ``softer" scientific and technological domains.
