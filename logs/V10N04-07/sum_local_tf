[194] 分析の結果、全ての分野で、語彙量が増大すると外来語の異なり比率が増大すること、農学を除いては、将来的に外来語の比率が漢語・和語の比率より大きくなること、与えられたデータにおいては例外的に見えた計算機科学がその点では農学を除く他の分野と同じ傾向を単に極端なかたちで実現しているに過ぎないこと、一方で、例外的なのは、農学分野における専門語彙構成であることが示された。

[section title : Introduction]
================================================================
[2279] Note that the quantitative analyses carried out so far are mostly static; they describe the quantitative characteristics of a given set of data. Static analyses of a given data, however, are in general not sufficient when dealing with language, because there are events or items which may not appear in the sample but do exist in the theoretical population. In analysing morphemes in terminology, therefore, it is necessary to use a method by which the nature of morphemes --- including those that do not appear in the data --- are properly accounted for. This is not only technically important but also theoretically essential as it assigns the model a moment of dynamics and thus a basis for expectation. Only through revealing the structural characteristics not explicit in the data itself can the nature of vocabulary can be fully observed. In the following, the nature of the terminological data used in this study is first briefly described. This is followed by the introduction of a theoretical model, that can properly treat a sample with unseen events, together with the method of binomial interpolation and extrapolation. This gives the basic framework for modelling the structural dynamics of morphemes in terminology. From there descriptions of the dynamic quantitative nature of morphemes of different types of origin in six sets of terminologies will ensue. This last section constitutes the central part of the present paper and its main contribution to the study of lexicology.

[section title : The Terminological Data]
================================================================
[2129] It is observed that, with the exception of the number of types in computer science (COM), both the type and token numbers of borrowed morphemes are smaller than those of native morphemes. The average frequency of the borrowed morphemes is smaller than that of the native morphemes in all of the data sets. From the terminological point of view, this tendency could be interpreted as follows: (i) The native morphemes are used to represent core conceptual elements which appear repeatedly in terminology (in terms of average frequency and token number), and (ii) although in terms of accommodating new concepts, the borrowed morphemes are used relatively more frequently, with the exception of computer science, the native morphemes still take a major role. However, as will be shown, this observation is too simplistic, if not incorrect. Technically, the problem is that, in language data in general, most statistical measures change systematically according to sample size [CITE].

[section title : Theoretical Model and the Status of Data]
================================================================
[906] We introduce here a dynamic statistical model which can treat the terminological data properly. In the process, we also confirm that the terminological data, like language data in general, anticipates unseen events, as we informally mentioned in the previous section.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Binomial/Poisson Model]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [1864] This will be the starting point of the binomial interpolation and extrapolation which will be introduced shortly to trace the structural dynamics of morphemes. Assuming this model, incidentally, we can check the statistical status of the terminological data. As discussed, it is widely held that there are always events that do not appear in a language sample. But do they really exist, for example, in the data in Table 1? Should we really take into account these morphemes that do not appear in the data? There is a convenient test to explore this, called the coefficient of loss [CITE].
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Binomial Interpolation and Extrapolation]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2245] By employing this methods, we can make explicit the quantitative nature of morphemes implicit in a given data. In other words, through binomial interpolation and extrapolation, we can observe how the ratio between borrowed and native morphemes was, is, and will be when the data is changed in size, as opposed to simply how it is in a given set of data. Although the actual value diverges around [MATH], the formula is sufficient for observing the basic dynamic characteristics of morphemes in a terminology within a realistic range of the terminological phenomena. Revealing the developmental profiles, therefore, explicates the structural characteristics of terminology. Recall, incidentally, that, as discussed above, the randomness assumption behind the binomial/Poisson model holds for terminological data in general. This is confirmed to be valid in the terminological data used in the present study, as observed in Figure [REF_fig:intext], which shows the developmental profiles of [MATH] and [MATH] obtained through binomial interpolation and extrapolation for up to twice the original sample size (lines), as well as the corresponding values obtained by 5,000 term-level (as opposed to morpheme-level) random permutations up to the original sample size for 20 equally-spaced intervals (dots).

[section title : The Growth of Morphemes and the Roles of Morphemes]
================================================================
[1627] As the binomial model of interpolation and extrapolation provides a valid estimation of the morphemes in a given terminology up to around twice the original sample size, we can now observe the developmental profiles of the behaviour of morphemes, in terms of their type of origin, in accordance with the changes in the size of the data within and beyond the original sample size. This allows us to form general expectations of how the morphemes of different types of origin should behave.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Patterns of the Growth of Morphemes]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2180] Figure [REF_fig:intext] charts the developmental profiles of morphemes in each of the six terminological domains, according to their types of origin. We can observe that, in all the domains, the growth curves of the borrowed morphemes are more ``straight" than the growth curves of the native morphemes. The developmental curves of the native morphemes tend to flatten out more quickly than the curves of the borrowed ones. We can expect that, although the number of different borrowed morphemes is smaller in all but one domain (computer science) at the given as well as at twice the given sample size, the relation may well be reversed when the sample is further increased. In the domains of chemistry and physics, borrowed morpheme types are expected to outnumber native morphemes fairly soon. This general estimation is informally reinforced by the fact that, in computer science, where the number of different borrowed morphemes is greater at the original sample size, there is a greater number of native morpheme types at the beginning of the sampling range, i.e. [MATH].
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Patterns of the Growth Rate]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2424] Focusing on the earlier stage of the sample range, the terminology of computer science is exceptional in its high dependency on borrowed morphemes. If we interpret the beginning stage of the sample size to be the stage at which core morphemes are introduced and consolidated, then computer science can be characterised by its heavy reliance on borrowed morphemes in the role of core morphemes. On the other hand, when the size of a terminology becomes bigger, newly introduced morphemes are expected to be used to add new concepts to the existing structure. As [MATH] approaches [MATH], the ratio of borrowed to native morpheme types converges to the ratio of their growth rates. From Figure [REF_fig:grate], we can expect that, as [MATH], there will be a greater number of different borrowed morphemes than the number of native morphemes in all of the domains but agriculture. In that sense, the informal observation given in 4.1 based on Figure [REF_fig:ratio1] has been rigidly confirmed. This leaves us with one domain, i.e. agriculture. In agriculture, it is not clear whether the growth rate of the borrowed and native morphemes will be reversed at all. In this sense, among the six different domains we observe here, it is agriculture that is exceptional in the use of morphemes of different types of origin in the construction of terminology.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Summary of the Observations]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2048] Summarising the observations above, we can conclude, from the developmental profiles of the morphemes and the transitions in their growth rates, that native morphemes tend to be used to constitute the core of a terminology. Because the first and main role of the native morphemes is to contribute to expressing the core conceptual elements, it is natural that the native morphemes are used more frequently than borrowed morphemes. As the terminology grows, on the other hand, the use of borrowed morphemes grows, in order to incorporate new concepts. As the new concepts are incorporated into the existing terminological structure, the core of which has already become stable [CITE], the average use of a borrowed morpheme remains relatively low, as is manifested by the low average frequency of the borrowed morphemes. This general tendency can be observed irrespective of domain. Turning our eyes to the differences among the domains, we can observe the following:

[section title : Conclusions]
================================================================
[2055] We have analysed the role of native and borrowed morphemes in the construction of the terminologies of six different domains, tracing the developmental patterns of the growth and the growth rates of morphemes. A few general as well as domain-dependent patterns in the use of morphemes were clarified. In the process, we introduced a theoretical framework based on the binomial/Poisson assumption, which was proved to provide a very useful and powerful method of analysing the dynamic patterns of morphological growth in terminology. The work reported here should be extended further, at least in three aspects. Firstly, we should extend the observation to the terminologies of other domains. This is not only in itself crucial as a descriptive quantitative study of terminology but also important for uncovering the general tendencies of terminological structure across different domains, which in turn would lead to the characterisation of technical terminology as a whole. Secondly, in order to fully explore the morphological structure in terminology, it is important to obtain reliable extrapolated values beyond [MATH].
