[194] 分析の結果、全ての分野で、語彙量が増大すると外来語の異なり比率が増大すること、農学を除いては、将来的に外来語の比率が漢語・和語の比率より大きくなること、与えられたデータにおいては例外的に見えた計算機科学がその点では農学を除く他の分野と同じ傾向を単に極端なかたちで実現しているに過ぎないこと、一方で、例外的なのは、農学分野における専門語彙構成であることが示された。

[section title : Introduction]
================================================================
[2003] Note that the quantitative analyses carried out so far are mostly static; they describe the quantitative characteristics of a given set of data. Static analyses of a given data, however, are in general not sufficient when dealing with language, because there are events or items which may not appear in the sample but do exist in the theoretical population. In analysing morphemes in terminology, therefore, it is necessary to use a method by which the nature of morphemes --- including those that do not appear in the data --- are properly accounted for. This is not only technically important but also theoretically essential as it assigns the model a moment of dynamics and thus a basis for expectation. Only through revealing the structural characteristics not explicit in the data itself can the nature of vocabulary can be fully observed.

[section title : The Terminological Data]
================================================================
[1934] It is observed that, with the exception of the number of types in computer science (COM), both the type and token numbers of borrowed morphemes are smaller than those of native morphemes. The average frequency of the borrowed morphemes is smaller than that of the native morphemes in all of the data sets. From the terminological point of view, this tendency could be interpreted as follows: (i) The native morphemes are used to represent core conceptual elements which appear repeatedly in terminology (in terms of average frequency and token number), and (ii) although in terms of accommodating new concepts, the borrowed morphemes are used relatively more frequently, with the exception of computer science, the native morphemes still take a major role.

[section title : Theoretical Model and the Status of Data]
================================================================
[906] We introduce here a dynamic statistical model which can treat the terminological data properly. In the process, we also confirm that the terminological data, like language data in general, anticipates unseen events, as we informally mentioned in the previous section.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Binomial/Poisson Model]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [1740] The column [MATH] in Table [REF_tab:quandata] indicates the values of the coefficient of loss for each data. The number of morpheme types is underestimated by around 20 per cent, which means that the sample relative frequency does not give a reliable estimate of the population probability. The data belong to what is called the LNRE (Large Number of Rare Events) zone of the sample range [CITE], where the population events (morpheme types) are far from being exhausted in the sample. In this situation, not only the sample relative frequencies but also almost all of the statistical measures as well as the parameters of the distribution models change systematically according to the sample size [CITE].
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Binomial Interpolation and Extrapolation]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [1896] By employing this methods, we can make explicit the quantitative nature of morphemes implicit in a given data. In other words, through binomial interpolation and extrapolation, we can observe how the ratio between borrowed and native morphemes was, is, and will be when the data is changed in size, as opposed to simply how it is in a given set of data. Although the actual value diverges around [MATH], the formula is sufficient for observing the basic dynamic characteristics of morphemes in a terminology within a realistic range of the terminological phenomena. Revealing the developmental profiles, therefore, explicates the structural characteristics of terminology.

================================================================

[section title : The Growth of Morphemes and the Roles of Morphemes]
================================================================
[1627] As the binomial model of interpolation and extrapolation provides a valid estimation of the morphemes in a given terminology up to around twice the original sample size, we can now observe the developmental profiles of the behaviour of morphemes, in terms of their type of origin, in accordance with the changes in the size of the data within and beyond the original sample size. This allows us to form general expectations of how the morphemes of different types of origin should behave.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Patterns of the Growth of Morphemes]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2159] The actual ratio of borrowed to native morpheme types differs from domain to domain, revealing the characteristics of each domain within the general pattern of borrowed and native morphemes. In computer science, as mentioned earlier, the number of different borrowed morphemes is already greater than that of native morphemes within the original sample size. In chemistry and physics, it is likely that the ratio will become greater than 1 within a realistic data size of the terminologies, say, [MATH]; while in botany and psychology, it is possible that the ratio will become bigger than 1 in due course, but at what data size this will occur is not clear. In agriculture, the opposite conclusion seems to be more reasonable. Thus it is the terminology of agriculture, not of computer science, that is exceptional in this respect. To confirm this informal and intuitive discussion more rigidly, it is useful to observe the growth rate of morphemes, to which we now turn.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Patterns of the Growth Rate]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [1888] On the other hand, when the size of a terminology becomes bigger, newly introduced morphemes are expected to be used to add new concepts to the existing structure. As [MATH] approaches [MATH], the ratio of borrowed to native morpheme types converges to the ratio of their growth rates. From Figure [REF_fig:grate], we can expect that, as [MATH], there will be a greater number of different borrowed morphemes than the number of native morphemes in all of the domains but agriculture. In that sense, the informal observation given in 4.1 based on Figure [REF_fig:ratio1] has been rigidly confirmed.
-----------------------------------------------------
  [subsection title : Summary of the Observations]
-----------------------------------------------------
  [2007] Summarising the observations above, we can conclude, from the developmental profiles of the morphemes and the transitions in their growth rates, that native morphemes tend to be used to constitute the core of a terminology. Because the first and main role of the native morphemes is to contribute to expressing the core conceptual elements, it is natural that the native morphemes are used more frequently than borrowed morphemes. As the terminology grows, on the other hand, the use of borrowed morphemes grows, in order to incorporate new concepts. As the new concepts are incorporated into the existing terminological structure, the core of which has already become stable [CITE], the average use of a borrowed morpheme remains relatively low, as is manifested by the low average frequency of the borrowed morphemes. This general tendency can be observed irrespective of domain.

[section title : Conclusions]
================================================================
[1636] The last point is related to the theoretical modelling of terminology. We have focused on the general difference between borrowed and native morphemes en masse in Japanese terminology, effectively ignoring the differences in such factors as term length distributions among different domains. To fully exploit the quantitative modelling of terminology, however, it will be necessary to take into account the wider characteristics terms, including the intra-term dependency patterns of morphemes, in addition to the nature of morphemes in terminology en masse.
