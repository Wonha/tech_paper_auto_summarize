 \eabstract{
 The ``{\it -desu/-masu}'' form not only functions as a formal
 language marker, it also indicates emotions/attitudes and characterizes
 some roles in conversation. These attribute of ``{\it -desu/-masu}''
 indicate ``psychological distance between speakers and addressees'', the
 relationship between speakers and addressees in communication and its
 change. This paper defines the language forms that require addressees,
 such as ``{\it -desu/-masu}'', as ``copresence markers'' that create
 copresent space independently of contexts. We model the structure of
 communication with the notion of a copresence marker and the degree of
 copresence determined by contexts. In copresence, ``{\it -desu/-masu}''
 indicates psychological distance. In nonpresence, however ``{\it
 -desu/-masu}'' does not typically appear, but a quasi-copresence sort of
 virtual space can be created by a copresence marker. In this case, the
 function of ``{\it -desu/-masu}'' as a copresence marker is foregrounded
 and an addressee is elicited. This relationship between a speaker and an
 addressee results in intimate emotion. Intimate emotions/attitudes can
 be explained by the function of a copresence marker that changes
 ``nonpresence'' into ``copresence''. Distance can be explained by the
 change of mental relationship between speakers and addressees with
 psychological distance operating in ``copresence''.}
