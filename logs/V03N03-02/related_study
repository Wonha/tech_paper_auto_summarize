 \eabstract{This paper describes the re-interpretation stage of
 understanding metaphor/simile. We define the meaning of a noun by
 using probability. The meaning of a metaphor/simile is the meaning of
 the tenor which is affected by the vehicle. We define {\it
 ``clarity''\/} and {\it ``novelty''\/}, which are based on the
 quantity of information, as measures of the meaning difference between
 metaphor/simile and tenor. The {\it clarity\/} of an attribute of a
 metaphor/simile measures the decrease in entropy. The {\it novelty\/}
 of an attribute of a metaphor/simile measures the increase in
 rareness. We measured the meanings of similes by using Semantic
 Differential and calculated their {\it clarity\/} and {\it novelty\/}. 
 We showed that the {\it clarity\/} of an attribute of a simile agreed
 well with the salience pattern of the vehicle, tenor, and simile. We
 also showed that the {\it clarity\/} and {\it novelty\/} of a simile
 agreed with the comprehensibility of the simile.}

 \label{sec:introduction}
 比喩は自然言語に遍在する．たとえば，李\cite{Yi82}によると，小説と新聞
 の社説とにおいて 比喩表現の出現率に大差はない．また，比喩を表現する者
 (話し手)は，比喩により 言いたいことを端的に表現する．したがって，自然
 言語処理の対象を科学技術文から評論や小説に拡大するためには，比喩の処理
 が必要である．
