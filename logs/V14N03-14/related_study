There have been many attempts to analyze reviews to a deeper level in order to improve accuracy. Mullen [CITE] used features from various information sources such as references to the ``work'' or ``artist'', which were annotated by hand, and showed that these features have the potential to improve accuracy. We use reference features given by the words around the fixed review target word (``book'').

Turney [CITE] used semantic orientation, which measures the distance from phrases to ``excellent'' or ``poor'' by using search engine results and gives the word polarity. Kudo [CITE] used decision stumps to capture substructures embedded in text (such as word-based dependency), and suggested that subtree features are important for opinion/modality classification.

Independently of and in parallel with our work, two other papers consider the degree of polarity for the purposes of sentiment classification. Koppel [CITE] exploited a neutral class and applied a regression method similar to that of the present study. Pang [CITE] applied a metric labeling method for the task in which similar reviews tend to have same polarities. Our work differs from these two studies in several respects. In the present study evaluation was carried out by exploiting square errors rather than precision errors, with a five-point scoring scale used in the experiments, in contrast to Koppel [CITE], who used three (``good'', ``bad'', ``neutral''), and Pang [CITE], who used three/four point scores. Therefore we use regression which minimize not a precision error but a square error. We argue that the precision errors are not enough to capture the task. Because if we use the precision errors mistakes of assigning [MATH] SP score to a review whose correct SP score is [MATH] can occur many times, which becomes unacceptable problem in real applications. We also examine various features to capture the characteristics of reviews, which are found to be effective in experiences.
