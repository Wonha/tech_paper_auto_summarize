In recent years, discussion groups, online shops, and blog systems on the Internet have gained popularity, and the number of documents, such as reviews, is growing dramatically. Sentiment classification refers to classifying reviews not by their topics but by the polarity of their sentiment (e.g, positive or negative).
It is useful for recommendation systems, fine-grained information retrieval systems, and business applications that collect opinions about a commercial product.
