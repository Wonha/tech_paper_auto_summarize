\section{Introduction}
\section{Temporal Relation Classification}
\subsection{Timebank corpus}
\section{Stacked model for temporal relation classification}
\subsection{Classification models}
This section explains our stacked learning approach for temporal relation classification.
The local (first stage of stacked learning) and global models (second stage) are described in Subsection \ref{subsubsec:localmodel} and \ref{subsubsec:globalmodel}, respectively.
\subsubsection{Local pairwise model}
\subsubsection{Global model}
\subsubsection{Using probability values as real-valued features}
In this section, the probability values of the prediction in the first stage are used in temporal relation classification as real-valued features.
\subsection{Relation inference and time--time connection}
To alleviate the timegraph sparsity problem, the relation inference of Subsection \ref{subsubsec:infer} and the time--time connection of Subsection \ref{subsubsec:time--time} are performed to increase timegraph density.
\subsubsection{Relation inference}
\subsubsection{Time--time connection}
After that, as introduced in Subsection \ref{subsubsec:infer}, new inference relations (\emph{\textbf{e1}}--\emph{\textbf{e2}}, \emph{\textbf{e1}}--\emph{\textbf{e3}}, \emph{\textbf{e2}}--\emph{\textbf{e3}}) are added.
\section{Experimental evaluation and results}
We trained our models on the Timebank corpus, introduced in Subsection \ref{subsec:tb}, which was provided by the TempEval-3 organizer. 
\subsection{Results on the training data}
\subsection{Results on the test data}
\subsection{Comparison with the state of the art}
\section{Discussion}
\section{Conclusion}
