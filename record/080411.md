# weighting each words
- weighting each words per documents in order to get important words in that document.

# weighting formula
- w{i,j} = tf{i,j} \* idf{j} = tf{i,j} \* log(N/df{j}) (where i is word index, j is document index)

# process
- input file: ./logs/tf\_table.md                                                  
- output file: ./logs/[each doc dir]/tf\_idf.md
